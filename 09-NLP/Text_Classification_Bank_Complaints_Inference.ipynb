I received an official letter from this company confirming the agreed payment plan in the mail dated for XX/XX/19. I mailed a check to credit collections solutions via priority mail on XX/XX/19 made out to XXXX XXXX, which is 9 days prior to the due date. I received a letter from credit collections services on XX/XX/19 stating that they have not received a payment as of XX/XX/19, and that they are canceling my payment plan. However in the same letter received on XX/XX/19 it clearly shows that the debt owed has reduced from XXXX to XXXX, which clearly proves that they did receive a payment. There would be no reason for me to make another payment until XX/XX/19 based on the payment agreement made with Credit Collection Services. Upon talking to one of their representatives on XX/XX/19, she insinuated that this is the companies standard practice, to send letters out to people stating that payment arrangements are being canceled even though they are actually adhering to the agreed payment plan. This person I spoke to on the phone was able to verify that they received a payment so there was no reason for this letter. Last but definitely not least, this company reported this false information on my credit report stating that they have not received a payment for XXXX when in fact per our payment agreement a payment would not be due until XX/XX/19.

              "54321  Payment on may Valley Bank credit card is due tomorrow XXXX XXXX. So my beloved wife XXXX and I drove to the local branch in XXXX a mile or so from our home. BUT THE DRIVE IN  WAS CLOSED AS WAS THE BRANCH ITSELF. So I mailed my check at the XXXX Post Office for hoped for delivery to the XXXX branch of the bank on XXXX XXXX! \\n\\nBut I fear that the Valley Bank will claim it did not receive my check on XXXX XXXX and so charge me a sky-high late fee which would be totally unjust as its branch and its branch drive in were closed as aforementioned! \\n\\nI SHALL NOT PAY ANY LATE FEE OR INTEREST NOR MAY THE VALLEY BANK REPORT ME TO THE CREDIT REPORTING  BUREAUS! \\n\\nThe branch should have been open even during the coronavirus pandemic!

              "22986  I was contacted by Credit Collections Services on XX/XX/19 in reference to an attempt to collect a debt owed to XXXX XXXX in the amount of XXXX. In response to this letter I set up a payment plan breaking the above amount in to three payments to be paid via check with the first payment to received by XX/XX/19. I received an official letter from this company confirming the agreed payment plan in the mail dated for XX/XX/19. I mailed a check to credit collections solutions via priority mail on XX/XX/19 made out to XXXX XXXX, which is 9 days prior to the due date. I received a letter from credit collections services on XX/XX/19 stating that they have not received a payment as of XX/XX/19, and that they are canceling my payment plan. However in the same letter received on XX/XX/19 it clearly shows that the debt owed has reduced from XXXX to XXXX, which clearly proves that they did receive a payment. There would be no reason for me to make another payment until XX/XX/19 based on the payment agreement made with Credit Collection Services. Upon talking to one of their representatives on XX/XX/19, she insinuated that this is the companies standard practice, to send letters out to people stating that payment arrangements are being canceled even though they are actually adhering to the agreed payment plan. This person I spoke to on the phone was able to verify that they received a payment so there was no reason for this letter. Last but definitely not least, this company reported this false information on my credit report stating that they have not received a payment for XXXX when in fact per our payment agreement a payment would not be due until XX/XX/19. I find this very unprofessional and a form of retaliation.  ...  CCS Financial Services, Inc.         \n",

              "11711  I contacted CONVERGENT OUTSOURCING and indicated I needed to know how the cable company ( XXXX ) had come to the amount they were trying to collect. ( {$400.00} ) I asked for them to send me a debt validation to include how they had come up to the amount. I indicated I had every intention to pay if I could figure out the nature of the charges as I believed that the owed amount was already addressed previously. I never got the debt validation and I see that this agency reported me to the credit bureau ( XXXX  ). I contacted the agency again and they informed me that they were going to report my account to yet another credit bureau unless I make the payment in full prior to them reporting it to XXXX  as well. I asked them if they had sent the debt validation via certified mail, since they would be able to see that I never got it. They claim certified mail is not a requirement and they only send via regular mail. I have verified the correct address but I am not getting the mail. Now I have two  options, wait for the debt validation and have my credit report be affected even more. Or make the payment blindly without getting the debt validation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ...

              "50141  I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and have applied for the XXXX  discharge months ago. My balance keeps going up with no explanation and negatively being reported on my credit report when I don't even have a payment due! I have submitted all of my letters from Social Security XXXX  to Nelnet to prove this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ...
