    "# Sentence Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence Segmentation or Sentence Tokenization is the process of identifying different sentences among group of words. spaCy library designed for Natural Language Processing, perform the sentence segmentation with much higher accuracy. However, lets first talk about, how we as a human identify the start and end of the sentence? Mostly with the help of the punctuations, right? And in most of the cases we say a sentence ends with a dot '.' character. So with this basic idea, we would say that we can split the string based on dot and get the different sentences. Do you think this logic would be enough to get all sentence tokens?\n",
    "\n",
    "What if there are some abbreviations within the sentences for example consider a sentence \"U.K. has two dots in its abbreviation.\" In this case our brain is trained in such a way that it would not consider dots present in between the abbreviation as the end of the sentence. However it keeps reading until it reaches the dot which actually ends the sentence. Now see in this case, our split logic will fail completely. This is where we need some model training by scratch in text corpus or use some pre-trained models and tweak them based on our specific need. spaCy provides different models for different languages. I will be explaining the concept with respect to English language model. For other language support and installation instructions please refer the documentation available at spacy.io official site. \n",
    "\n",

    "So, in this section we'll learn how sentence segmentation works, and how to set user defined segmentation rules."
